/**
 @abstract Session object to access Yandex Disk.

 @discussion
 This class is a wrapper around the Yandex Disk Cloud API.

 Using this class saves the trouble of implementing WebDAV and OAuth2.0 authentication.
 
 The methods of this class makes it easy to:
 - authenticate,
 - list directory content,
 - access file information,
 - up- and download files,
 - publish and unpublish files stored in Yandex Disk

 To use this class you first have to register your app at:
 - [Yandex OAuth app registration page]( https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new )

 More information about the implemented API can be found at:
 - the [Yandex Disk API page]( http://api.yandex.ru/disk/ )
 - and [Yandex OAuth2 API page]( http://api.yandex.ru/oauth/ ).

 This implementation requires ARC!
