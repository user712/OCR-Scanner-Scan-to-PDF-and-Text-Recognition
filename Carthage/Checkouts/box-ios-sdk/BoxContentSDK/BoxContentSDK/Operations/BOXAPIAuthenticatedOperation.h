/**
 * BOXAPIAuthenticatedOperation is an abstract base class for all API operations that
 * require authentication with Box. Because this class is abstract, you should not instantiate
 * it directly. Instead, use one of its subclasses:
 *
 * - BOXAPIJSONOperation
 * - BOXAPIMultipartToJSONOperation
 * - BOXAPIDataOperation
 *
 * This class encapsulates logic for handling expired access tokens. If an access token is found
 * to be expired, instances will request an attempt to refresh access tokens and will attempt
 * to reenqueue the failed operation.
 *
 * Error Conditions
 * ================
 * ...
 *
 * @warning Only members of the class BOXAPIJSONOperation may be reenqueued. Neither
 * BOXAPIMultipartToJSONOperation nor BOXAPIDataOperation instances may be reenqueued because they
 * contain properties that cannot be copied (subclasses of NSStream).
